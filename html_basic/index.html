    <h1>Welcome to My Awesome Page!</h1>

    <h2>About This Page</h2>

    <p>
        This is my very first webpage that I'm building as part of my web development journey.
        I'm excited to learn HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create interactive and beautiful sites.
    </p>

    <h3>My Learning Journey</h3>

    <p>
        So far, I've learned about basic HTML structure, including DOCTYPE, head, and body.
        I've also practiced creating headings and paragraphs, which are fundamental building blocks of any webpage.
    </p>

    <p>
        One of the recent challenges involved using the terminal with Node.js to run JavaScript scripts,
        and understanding how to handle command-line arguments and loops. It's fascinating how different
        environments handle the same code!
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm looking forward to diving deeper into styling with CSS next, and then bringing it all to life with JavaScript interactivity.
        Every step is a new discovery!
    </p>
